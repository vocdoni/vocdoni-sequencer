	// Order returns the order of the elliptic curve group.
	// This is the number of elements in the group, represented as a big integer.

	// Add adds two elliptic curve group elements and stores the result in the receiver.
	// a and b are the elements to be added.
	Add(a, b Point)

	// SafeAdd adds two elliptic curve group elements and stores the result in the receiver.

	// Multiplies the group element a by the scalar value.

	// This point acts as the identity element in elliptic curve arithmetic.
